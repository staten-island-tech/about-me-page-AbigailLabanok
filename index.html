    <p>Hello! My name is Abigail Labanok, although must people call me Abby. I'm 14 years old and a sophmore at Staten Island Technical Highschool. I really enjoy doing theatre and singing. It has become one of my biggest personal hobbies over the years. I particpated in last years school theater performances and I will be starting this year off by participating in SING. I also love going to Times Square with my mom to watch different types of musicals. I also really enjoy gaming. One of the games that I really (really) enjoy playing is Valorant. Some other games that I also like playing are Minecraft and Slime Rancher.</p>
